# smart-contract-lottery
This project enables blockchain users to participate in a lottery by paying a minimal fee (measured in USD). It achieves this by retrieving real-world data, such as exchange rates, through Chainlink price feeds. It then obtains a random number from an oracle on the blockchain, allowing for the selection of a random lottery winner. Additionally, the project includes unit tests in Python. This project applies Chainlink documentation.
